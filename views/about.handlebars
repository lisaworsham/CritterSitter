                <p>I am an avid outdoorsman who loves to spend time walking around with my dogs. I also do a good amount of travelling so an aplication that helps me keep in touch when the dogs can't join is very valuable to me.</p>

                <p>Typically I'm a homebody who enjoys experiencing the world through videogames or making one up in Dungeons and Dragons. But, sometimes, you have to experience things for real and I can't always bring my goofy lap dog with me... no matter how much she gives me those big puppy eyes.</p>

                <p>My wife and I like to get away with our 4 kids, but it's hard with 3 pets. And my kids really care about their animals. Having an app that easily allows to both connect with trusted pet sitters who we know and communicate with them during a trip would provide emmense piece of mind. </p>

                <p>I love to travel, especially abroad, whenever I get the chance. Unfortunately, my dog can't make those trips and I need for someone to watch her when I'm go.</p>
